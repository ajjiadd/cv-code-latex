# Abdullah Al Jiad's CV

This repository contains the LaTeX source code for my professional CV, designed to showcase my skills, education, projects, and experience as a Computer Science and Engineering student.

## Overview

The CV is crafted using LaTeX to ensure a modern, clean, and professional layout. It highlights my technical expertise, academic background, and entrepreneurial experience, tailored for software development and tech-related job opportunities.



## How to Compile

To compile the CV into a PDF, follow these steps:

1. **Install LaTeX**: Ensure you have a LaTeX distribution installed (e.g., TeX Live or MiKTeX).
2. **Dependencies**: The CV uses the following LaTeX packages:
   - `roboto`
   - `fontawesome5`
   - `geometry`
   - `hyperref`
   - `titlesec`
   - `enumitem`
   - `xcolor`
   - `inputenc`
   - `fontenc`
3. **Compile**: Run the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   pdflatex cv.tex
   ```
   This will generate `cv.pdf`.

## Customization

- Modify `cv.tex` to update personal information, skills, projects, or other sections.
- Adjust the LaTeX preamble for different fonts, colors, or layouts to match your preferences.
